in ADO , delete the pipeline and repository, remove the yml file- azure-pipelines.yml

-------------------------Select Repo, create pipeline
Create a new Pipeline->Select Github as repository->configure: Deploy to Azure Kubernetes Service=> This will cover build, cont. integration and deployment
Choose Cluster= myAKSClusterm01, Namespace= Existing, default, Container Registry= shoppingacrm01, imagename= shoppingapi, serviceport= 80
-> Validate and Configure.

Now check ->Project settings-> Service Connection -> 2 Service Connections a)myAKSClusterm01-default b)shoppingacrm01-1208
Check Pipeline-> Environments-> go to the default cluster-> It will show all informations of AKS like pod, deployment, replica set etc.

When you click on Save and Run, it will commit below files in github repository
azure-pipelines.yml
manifests/deployment.yml
manifests/service.yml

Error : ##[error]COPY failed: file not found in build context or excluded by .dockerignore: stat Shopping.API/Shopping.API.csproj: file does not exist
##[error]The process '/usr/bin/docker' failed with exit code 1

Fix: In Vs code, pull the latest code which contains below files
azure-pipelines.yml
manifests/deployment.yml
manifests/service.yml

In azure-pipelines.yml-> 
a)add buildContext in build task
containerRegistry: $(dockerRegistryServiceConnection)
buildContext: $(Build.SourceDirectory)/Shopping
 tags: |
 $(tag)
b) Change Deployment task- from
manifests: |
                $(Pipeline.Workspace)/manifests/deployment.yml
                $(Pipeline.Workspace)/manifests/service.yml

To 
manifests: |
                $(Pipeline.Workspace)/manifests/shoppingapi.yaml

c) combine deployment and service defination in a new manifests/shoppingapi.yaml
In order to do that copy the content from .\aks\shoppingapi.yaml to manifest\shoppingapi.yaml
Delete- 
manifests/deployment.yml
manifests/service.yml

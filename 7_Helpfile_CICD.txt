in ADO , delete the pipeline and repository, remove the yml file- azure-pipelines.yml

-------------------------Select Repo, create pipeline
Create a new Pipeline->Select Github as repository->configure: Deploy to Azure Kubernetes Service=> This will cover build, cont. integration and deployment
Choose Cluster= myAKSClusterm01, Namespace= Existing, default, Container Registry= shoppingacrm01, imagename= shoppingapi, serviceport= 80
-> Validate and Configure.

Now check ->Project settings-> Service Connection -> 2 Service Connections a)myAKSClusterm01-default b)shoppingacrm01-1208
Check Pipeline-> Environments-> go to the default cluster-> It will show all informations of AKS like pod, deployment, replica set etc.

When you click on Save and Run, it will commit below files in github repository
azure-pipelines.yml
manifests/deployment.yml
manifests/service.yml

Error : ##[error]COPY failed: file not found in build context or excluded by .dockerignore: stat Shopping.API/Shopping.API.csproj: file does not exist
##[error]The process '/usr/bin/docker' failed with exit code 1

Fix: In Vs code, pull the latest code which contains below files
azure-pipelines.yml
manifests/deployment.yml
manifests/service.yml

In azure-pipelines.yml-> 
a)add buildContext in build task
containerRegistry: $(dockerRegistryServiceConnection)
buildContext: $(Build.SourceDirectory)/Shopping
 tags: |
 $(tag)
b) Change Deployment task- from
manifests: |
                $(Pipeline.Workspace)/manifests/deployment.yml
                $(Pipeline.Workspace)/manifests/service.yml

To 
manifests: |
                $(Pipeline.Workspace)/manifests/shoppingapi.yaml

c) combine deployment and service defination in a new manifests/shoppingapi.yaml
In order to do that copy the content from .\aks\shoppingapi.yaml to manifest\shoppingapi.yaml
Delete- 
manifests/deployment.yml
manifests/service.yml

Job Success

--------------------------------------Create a custom pipeline from the ADO generated YAML and Remove the ADO generated Pipeline
Challange of the current process
same shoppingapi.yaml now exist in 2 locations manifests(to be use by azurepipeline.yml) and aks folder ( to be executed by kubectl)

Create a new folder - pipelines and new file - shoppingapi-pipeline.yaml, copy content from azure-pipelines.yml(which was originally generated from ado) and refactor
Delete azure-pipelines.yml and manifests folder

In ADO, delete the pipeline - manabbasu.run-devops

Push the changes to git

Create new pipeline in ADO from github repo
	In configure your pipeline, choose- Existing Azure Pipelines YAML File
		Branch: main
		Path: /pipelines/shoppingapi-pipeline.yaml
		Run

Success

Validation: Azure Portal-> shoppingacrm01-> Repositories-> Shopping api-> see the versions
-------------------------------Create shopping Client Pipeline
In ADO, Rename the existing pipeline from manabbasu.run-devops to shoppingapi-pipeline

In code, Duplicate pipelines\shoppingapi-pipeline and save as shoppingclient-pipeline. Refactor the file(API to CLient)

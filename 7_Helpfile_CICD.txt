in ADO , delete the pipeline and repository, remove the yml file- azure-pipelines.yml

-------------------------Select Repo, create pipeline
Create a new Pipeline->Select Github as repository->configure: Deploy to Azure Kubernetes Service=> This will cover build, cont. integration and deployment
Choose Cluster= myAKSClusterm01, Namespace= Existing, default, Container Registry= shoppingacrm01, imagename= shoppingapi, serviceport= 80
-> Validate and Configure.

Now check ->Project settings-> Service Connection -> 2 Service Connections a)myAKSClusterm01-default b)shoppingacrm01-1208
Check Pipeline-> Environments-> go to the default cluster-> It will show all informations of AKS like pod, deployment, replica set etc.

When you click on Save and Run, it will commit below files in github repository
azure-pipelines.yml
manifests/deployment.yml
manifests/service.yml

Error : ##[error]COPY failed: file not found in build context or excluded by .dockerignore: stat Shopping.API/Shopping.API.csproj: file does not exist
##[error]The process '/usr/bin/docker' failed with exit code 1

Fix: In Vs code, pull the latest code which contains below files
azure-pipelines.yml
manifests/deployment.yml
manifests/service.yml

In azure-pipelines.yml-> 
a)add buildContext in build task
containerRegistry: $(dockerRegistryServiceConnection)
buildContext: $(Build.SourceDirectory)/Shopping
 tags: |
 $(tag)
b) Change Deployment task- from
manifests: |
                $(Pipeline.Workspace)/manifests/deployment.yml
                $(Pipeline.Workspace)/manifests/service.yml

To 
manifests: |
                $(Pipeline.Workspace)/manifests/shoppingapi.yaml

c) combine deployment and service defination in a new manifests/shoppingapi.yaml
In order to do that copy the content from .\aks\shoppingapi.yaml to manifest\shoppingapi.yaml
Delete- 
manifests/deployment.yml
manifests/service.yml

Job Success

--------------------------------------Create a custom pipeline from the ADO generated YAML and Remove the ADO generated Pipeline
Challange of the current process
same shoppingapi.yaml now exist in 2 locations manifests(to be use by azurepipeline.yml) and aks folder ( to be executed by kubectl)

Create a new folder - pipelines and new file - shoppingapi-pipeline.yaml, copy content from azure-pipelines.yml(which was originally generated from ado) and refactor
Delete azure-pipelines.yml and manifests folder

In ADO, delete the pipeline - manabbasu.run-devops

Push the changes to git

Create new pipeline in ADO from github repo
	In configure your pipeline, choose- Existing Azure Pipelines YAML File
		Branch: main
		Path: /pipelines/shoppingapi-pipeline.yaml
		Run

Success

Validation: Azure Portal-> shoppingacrm01-> Repositories-> Shopping api-> see the versions
-------------------------------Create shopping Client Pipeline
In ADO, Rename the existing pipeline from manabbasu.run-devops to shoppingapi-pipeline

In code, Duplicate pipelines\shoppingapi-pipeline and save as shoppingclient-pipeline. Refactor the file(API to CLient)

In ADO, create a new pipeline(source github, choose repo, existing azure pipelines YAML file)

>kubectl get pod --watch

> go to the AKS->myAKSClusterm01->Services and ingress-> copy the external IP and hit in browser => This 20.76.198.65 page canâ€™t be found
SOLVE:
> kubectl get pod
>kubectl logs
>kubectl logs <EACH POD NAME>

Check the Env Variable
>kubectl exec -it shoppingclient-deployment-5cf548b758-6k7gb -- sh => Open interactive terminal
>printenv => List of env variable and value, check the URLS/ endpoint

No Issue found

Check ADO-> Pipeline -> Check log for each step of shopping client pipeline-> View raw logs
The line found under build and push stage- 
2021-10-23T00:15:43.6690031Z [command]/usr/bin/docker build -f /home/vsts/work/1/s/Shopping/Shopping.API/Dockerfile --label 

Fix- In both pipelines\shoppingapi-pipeline.yaml and pipelines\shoppingclient-pipeline.yaml, under variables
change from 
  dockerfilePath: '**/Dockerfile' to Shopping/Shopping.API/Dockerfile and Shopping/Shopping.Client/Dockerfile

Push to git
It will not trigger the pipeline as those files are not mentioned in the included folder.
Change in Home\index.cshtml to trigger client application
go to the AKS->myAKSClusterm01->Services and ingress-> copy the external IP and hit in browser => This will show the page

In the ADO - Rename the pipeline name to shoppingclient-pipeline

--------------------Delete all k8 resources from azure
>kubectl delete -f .\aks\
>kubectl get all
